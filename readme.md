## Introduction

With the rapid growth of the pharmaceutical industry, counterfeit drugs have become a major concern, posing serious risks to public health and safety. The current supply chain systems are often inefficient, vulnerable to fraud, and lack transparency. To address these challenges, this platform uses **blockchain technology** to record all transactions related to pharmaceutical products, ensuring that every step—from manufacturing to distribution to retail—can be traced back to its origin.

By providing a decentralized, tamper-proof ledger, the platform guarantees the authenticity of drugs and promotes transparency across the entire supply chain. The platform enables real-time tracking, **digital wallet-based user authentication**, and regulatory compliance, making it a trusted tool for stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry.


## Why This Platform is Needed

### The Growing Problem of Counterfeit Drugs

Counterfeit pharmaceuticals pose a serious threat to global public health, with millions of counterfeit drugs entering the market each year. These drugs often contain harmful substances, are ineffective, or cause dangerous side effects, resulting in significant harm to patients. In many cases, counterfeit drugs enter the supply chain due to gaps in traceability and lack of transparency among different stakeholders.

### Lack of Transparency and Trust

Traditional pharmaceutical supply chain systems rely on centralized databases and paper-based records, which are prone to errors, manipulation, and fraud. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to track the journey of a product from manufacturer to end consumer.

### Regulatory Compliance

The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, and ensuring compliance with safety standards is essential. Traditional systems struggle to maintain real-time, auditable records, making it difficult for regulatory bodies to track products and verify their authenticity.

### Need for an Efficient, Secure Solution

The platform provides an efficient and secure solution by using blockchain to record transactions, ensuring that product data cannot be tampered with and can be easily verified by all stakeholders involved.


## How It Works

The platform operates on the principles of **transparency**, **security**, and **real-time data access**. Here’s how it works:

### Key Features

1. **Blockchain-Powered Product Verification**:
   - Every product is assigned a unique identifier and tracked on the Ethereum blockchain.  
   - Smart contracts are used to automate product verification and transactions.  
   - Users can scan QR codes on products to verify their authenticity in real-time using the blockchain.

2. **Decentralized Transactions**:
   - All transactions, including purchases, sales, and product updates, are recorded on the blockchain.  
   - The decentralized ledger ensures that data is immutable and transparent, providing a secure record of every product transaction.

3. **Real-Time Product Tracking**:
   - The platform allows real-time tracking of pharmaceutical products throughout the supply chain.  
   - Stakeholders can monitor the status of products as they move from manufacturers to distributors to retailers.

4. **Digital Wallet Authentication**:
   - Users authenticate using digital wallets like MetaMask, eliminating the need for traditional login systems and enhancing security.  
   - The use of blockchain-based wallets ensures that users have full control over their identity and transactions.

5. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - The platform provides easy access to detailed transaction logs and product history, which can be used for audits and regulatory compliance.

6. **Sign Protocol for Blockchain Transactions**:
   - The platform uses the **Sign Protocol** to ensure that blockchain transactions are authenticated and validated securely.  
   - This protocol adds an additional layer of security and ensures that only authorized users can initiate and validate transactions on the blockchain.

### System Architecture

The system is composed of the following key components:

1. **Frontend**:
   - Built using **React.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and **TypeScript**, the frontend offers a clean, responsive interface for users to interact with the platform.  
   - Features include product browsing, verification, transaction history, and user account management.

2. **Backend**:
   - The backend is built on **Node.js** and **Express.js**, handling API requests, smart contract interactions, and database management.  
   - **Web3.js** is used for blockchain integration to communicate with Ethereum smart contracts.

3. **Blockchain**:
   - **Ethereum** serves as the blockchain platform, providing decentralized, secure, and immutable transaction records.  
   - **Solidity** is used to write smart contracts that automate product verification and transactions.

4. **Database**:
   - **MongoDB** is used to store product data, transaction logs, and user information for quick retrieval and reporting.


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, Web3.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity, Smart Contracts, Sign Protocol  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Authentication**: MetaMask, JWT  
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS


## Installation and Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
   cd your-project-folder
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd api
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up MongoDB:
   - Install and run MongoDB locally or set up a cloud-based MongoDB instance.

   npm run dev
   ```


## Usage

Once the platform is running, users can:

1. **Sign in** using their digital wallet (MetaMask).  
2. **Browse available products** and verify their authenticity by scanning the QR code.  
3. **Add new products** and sell them, ensuring that transactions are recorded on the blockchain.  
4. **Track products** in real-time as they move through the supply chain.


## Future Enhancements

1. **AI and Machine Learning Integration**:
   - Implement AI to predict product demand and optimize supply chain processes.

2. **Advanced Reporting and Analytics**:
   - Provide real-time analytics and reporting for stakeholders to monitor supply chain performance.

3. **Cross-Platform Integration**:
   - Enable integration with other blockchain-based platforms and IoT devices for more precise tracking.

4. **Mobile Application**:
